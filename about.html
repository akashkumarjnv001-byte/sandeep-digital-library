  <h2>📖 Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Sandeep Digital Library wasn’t built overnight. It started with one simple chair in a rented room.
    Our founder, Sandeep Bhaiya, comes from a small village, where finding a peaceful place to study was impossible.
    After failing several competitive exams due to lack of resources and guidance, he made a promise:
    "If I can’t crack it, I will build a place for others to succeed."
  </p>
  <p>
    From selling pickles door-to-door to saving every rupee, Sandeep Bhaiya created this calm learning space where every student
    — whether from city or village — can study without pressure, without judgment.
